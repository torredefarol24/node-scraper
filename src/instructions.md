Thank you for your interest in our opportunities and for your enthusiasm to do the test task.
Below we share suggestions to have in mind to increase your chances of success.

General thoughts:

1. From this task we will create an impression on what to expect from you during a day-to-day
   work. If it is messy, disorganized, not following the best practices of throwing errors – in our
   eyes that is how you are likely to work day to day. If it is clean, well architected and working
   nicely – that’s what you should be delivering day to day.
2. Typical expectation from our client is focus on QUALITY. If you do task quickly, but not well,
   this is a way to rejection. Taking a bit more time and doing it properly is a correct way.
3. Follow the best practices even if these are not stated in the requirements. It is BY
   DEFAULT you are expected to follow these, even if not required in written.
4. Deadline extension is better than rushed and crappy submission.
5. We are looking for independent thinkers who can code. Not coders who cannot think for
   themselves. That is why some parts of the task might not be super clear. We expect you to
   make your decisions there as you see it there. If you see it could be important – comment
   your decisions in readme.
6. Its ok to ask. Of course, there could be an error or not clear requirements from our side.

Practical suggestions:

1. Code must work! And not only on your machine :)
2. Solution must run cleanly, no errors. Works but with errors does not count as “works” for us.
3. Simple, efficient, and clean code is the way.
4. Do not overcomplicate things. Overengineered code is usually seen as a disadvantage.
   Exception – if specific tool or solution is required in the task requirements. Then you are
   expected to follow requirements.
5. Follow the style guides - PEP, PSR, etc. Code should be properly formatted.
6. Test what matters for the business.
7. Tests must pass or no tests at all. Avoid failing tests.
8. Avoid hardcoding, hacks.
9. Do not forget to comment the code where relevant.
10. Think about performance and security of your code.
11. Use reasonable and adequate variable names.

it the way it is not obvious in a bad way that you took some other project. Crude copy paste
is a NO no. 13. Clear detailed readme is better than no readme or poor readme. 14. Tell us how to launch it. 15. Submit as github public link, UNLESS required differently in the task.

If not enough of time to do full task, then do part of it very well, and comment in the readme
what you did not do due to time limitations. This is way to show that you read requirements and
it decided to skip some due to lack of time, not that you simply ignored some.

Best of luck to you!
